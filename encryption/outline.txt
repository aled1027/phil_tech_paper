- Is encryption a fundamental right?
- Do we have a right to anonymity?

## Facts and Observations
- Do we expect privacy?
    - we email like we expect privacy
    - tantamount to before we were worried about FBI listening to conversation via secret mic
- Encryption feels like resistance
- NEST tropes
- surveillence state
- 

- Infrastructure difference
    - we do not own the physical network underlying network - we pay someone for the service of using it
    - does that make a difference? do we have a right to privacy on it?
    
- why are we having this argument in the first place?
- hitler famously used encryption
- guess: 
    - enc is accessible to all of us
    - we know that NSA or others are reading our stuff
- this leads to Enc being resistance
- why is seeking privacy resistance?

- United Nations Human Right Council
